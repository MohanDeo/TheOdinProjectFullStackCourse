    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>
    This link just opens the specified webpage.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>
    This link opens the webpage in a new tab. The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.
    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. This is important for security, to prevent phising attacks.</p>
    
    <p><a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
    This is a relative link - it contains a link to another of our webpages. The other links above are absolute links. We added a `./` at the beginning of the path to state that the path is relative. This prevents potential issues.</p>
