    Every project needs an `index.html` file. Browsers look for this.
    When creating a HTML doc, we need to specify the DOCTYPE (what version of HTML to use tp render the doc).
    We should then specify our HTML tab, wheere we give the language as an attribute. This allows screen readers to read our webpage aloud correctly if they are needed.
    In the `head` section, we should not enter any information to be displayed. Instead, we add any `meta` information, such as the character encoding.
